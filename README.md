The purpose of my "Brain Games" project is to expand my understanding of code, as well as explore more of my interests and disinterests when it comes to coding. I've found that completing projects that have to do with games, or creating some kind of activity, is much easier for me and allows ideas to flow much faster. Due to this I find myself thinking about different things to implement even when im not specifically working on the projectfor exmample, at work, or during dinner, cleaning, even at the gym. In order to compile and run the code you can simply copy the code into any compiler and run it. there should be no problems. The code can be ran full screen, or parital. As it is text based theres no need for any extra steps.
